# Time-varying graph representation learning via higher-order skip-gram with negative sampling

Repository where we show how the method presented in [1] can be applied to data about face-to-face proximity relations collected by the SocioPatterns collaboration [2].

The `data/` folder contains preprocessed time-varying proximity data (with the nights removed) and corresponding metadata with class labels. The original raw data can be found in http://www.sociopatterns.org/datasets/. Furthermore it contains SIR spreading realizations on each presented dataset.

The `code/` folder contains Jupyter notebooks to execute the method on the empirical datasets:
1. [MakeVariousSupraNetworks](code/MakeVariousSupraNetworks.ipynb): To build and save networkx supra-adjacency graphs.
2. [MakeVariousSupraSparseTensors](code/MakeVariousSupraSparseTensors.ipynb): To build co-occurrence tensors from supra-adjacency graphs.
3. [RemoveEvents](code/RemoveEvents.ipynb): To remove events from empirical temporal graphs and save results.
4. To embed different higher-order representations and test them in downstream tasks.
