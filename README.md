# Time-varying graph representation learning via higher-order skip-gram with negative sampling

Repository where we show how the method HOSGNS (Higher-Order Skip-Gram with Negative Sampling) can be applied to face-to-face proximity data (http://www.sociopatterns.org/), and to synthetic data generated by an agent-based model (https://github.com/BDI-pathogens/OpenABM-Covid19).

## Repository organization

The `data/` folder contains preprocessed time-varying proximity data and corresponding metadata with class labels (where they are available). The original raw data can be found in http://www.sociopatterns.org/datasets/. Furthermore it contains SIR spreading realizations on each presented dataset.

The `code/` folder contains Jupyter notebooks to execute the method on presented datasets:
1. [MakeVariousSupraNetworks](code/MakeVariousSupraNetworks.ipynb): To build and save networkx supra-adjacency graphs.
2. [MakeVariousSupraSparseTensors](code/MakeVariousSupraSparseTensors.ipynb): To build co-occurrence tensors from supra-adjacency graphs (not needed for synthetic datasets).
3. [RemoveEvents](code/RemoveEvents.ipynb): To remove events from empirical temporal graphs and save results.
4. To embed different higher-order representations and test them in downstream tasks.

## Requirements

The repository required packages can be installed from `requirements.txt`. To run the code on OpenABM (last two notebooks) the libraries [GEM](https://github.com/palash1992/GEM) and [SNAP](https://github.com/snap-stanford/snap) are also needed. The code has been tested under Python 3.6.
